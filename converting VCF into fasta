Converting the vcf file (MT) into fasta format

# Input VCF file and reference FASTA file
VCF="renamed_genome_asia_mt.vcf.gz"
REFERENCE="rCRS.fasta"

# File containing the sample names

# Loop through each sample in the samples.txt file

    bcftools consensus -s "$SAMPLE" "$VCF" -f "$REFERENCE" > "${SAMPLE}_consensus.fasta"
